# Hello!

My name is Adrian Kirsten, and I am a UX focused Frontend Developer based in Pretoria South Africa.

I have been building cool stuff for the web since 2004, ranging from simple websites to apps & even a Holobooth (ask me about this!).
I have a deep love for design, ux and development. I am motivated, responsible and love what I do.

I am a strong believer in the right tool for the right job. I also believe that anything can be learned, adjusted to where itâ€™s required. I am growth focused, and believe in surrounding myself with people who are smarter and more experienced than myself.

I have spent the last 5 years primarily in the React ecosystem (with some Nodejs, Dart & Flutter mixed in). Alongside this I covered roles in UI Design & UX Design.
